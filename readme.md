# Bayesian Network Classifier for Thyroid Disease

This project implements a Bayesian Network classifier using the UCI Thyroid Disease dataset. The classifier predicts the thyroid condition (Hyperthyroid, Hypothyroid, Normal) based on medical features (T3, T4, TSH).

## Dataset

The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: 
[Thyroid Disease Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/thyroid-disease/new-thyroid.data).

## Installation

To run this project, install the required dependenciesÂ using:
pip install -r requirements.txt
