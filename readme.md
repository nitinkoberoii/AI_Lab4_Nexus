# Thyroid Bayesian Network Classifier

## Overview

This project implements a Bayesian Network classifier to diagnose thyroid conditions (Hyperthyroid, Hypothyroid, Normal) using the UCI Thyroid Disease dataset. The implementation leverages the pgmpy library for creating and training the Bayesian Network, and scikit-learn for dataset handling and evaluation.

## Files

- main.py: Main script to train and evaluate the Bayesian Network model.
- requirements.txt: List of Python package dependencies.
- README.md: Project overview and instructions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nitinkoberoii/AI_Lab4_Nexus.git
    

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    bash
    cd thyroid-bayesian-network
    

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    

## Usage

Run the main script to execute the Bayesian Network classifier:
```bash
python main.py
